# 🧑‍💻 Seunguk Roh

**Solver Engineer @ Ansys Motion**<br />
Specializing in **Multibody Dynamics**, **contact & collision modeling**, and **high-performance C++ computation**.

I work on developing robust numerical algorithms for large-scale mechanical simulations — particularly contact, constraint modeling, flexible bodies, and cable/beam formulations.<br />
Outside work, I enjoy building userscripts, automation tools, and experimenting with geometry & numerical methods.
